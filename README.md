# amdb-and-ss3-build-devcontainer
This is a template to create a codespace for Stock Synthesis developers that builds ADMB 13.1 from source, builds the [Stock Synthesis repository](https://github.com/nmfs-stock-synthesis/stock-synthesis/releases/download/v3.30.21/ss_linux) and associated R packages ([r4ss](https://github.com/r4ss/r4ss), [ss3diags](https://github.com/PIFSCstockassessments/ss3diags), and [ss3sim](https://github.com/ss3sim/ss3sim)) on a Linux machine using R version 4.1 (there are issues with the image for R 4.2 and it could not build using R 4.3).
